						An eclectic writer from a very young age, Anastasia Mamontenko began to nurture her passion for story telling by writing her very first short story at the age of 7 as a gift for her parents. Upon receiving praise, she began to write plays for her friends and rehearse occasional performances for their families. She also wrote plays for school and performed in them, one being “Peaches” by ‘O. Henry’, a televised play that attracted guests from the region. At 14, Anastasia published her first collection of short stories titled “First Day of Spring”, mostly devoted to young love and stories of friendship. While her books sold at the GreenWave Book Market, she decided to spend time at orphanages giving readings to various groups of children that she grew close to.
A powerful influence in Anastasia’s life was her grandfather, a writer and artist, who inspired her to publish her second collection of short stories, “Three Skies”, at age 16. Though all rewarding as experiences, she pursued her truest passion of filmmaking soon after, taking courses at the Odessa Film Studio and writing/directing a feature, “Sadom”, about a teenage girl struggling with her imperfect world and falling for an optimistic paraplegic inspiring her to create her perfect world within. The film was placed in the ‘Young Filmmakers’ Program at the Odessa International Film Festival, an experience she will always cherish. At 18 Anastasia pursued an apprenticeship at the London College of Communications, leading her to a filmmaking conservatory at the New York Film Academy in Los Angeles upon completion. She is scheduled to complete another conservatory in screenwriting next year while actively exposing her film through the international festival network.
Anastasia hopes to continue to create stories and worlds that will stir a tapestry of feelings and emotions in international audiences, to challenge their mindsets and inspire a conversation revolving the improvement of our human experience.
