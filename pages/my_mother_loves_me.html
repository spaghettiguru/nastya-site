					<h3>Director's Statement</h3>
					<p>
						As a result of my Ukrainian heritage and the recent events that shaped my country’s revolution, I felt in me a strong desire to bring light to the absurdity I was observing in the world. There is a powerful sense of disconnection between morality and the behaviors of human beings in times of war. I witnessed disturbing footage of rioters ‘playing’ with dead bodies in the midst of their violent rampages. It paid tribute to the irrational behavior of our generation, acting out in inappropriate ways in order to entertain themselves.
					</p>
					<p>
						I was also inspired by a segment from Bunuel’s “Phantom of Liberty”, where a mother learns of her daughter’s disappearance and frantically asks her teacher where she’s been, all the while her daughter screaming “Mom, I’m here!” right by her side. It felt similar in theme to a bizarre dream I once had, where I floated through a bar and witnessed human beings walking around an art display of a dead person, an artistic choice by the designer. These experiences all felt to be an accurate representation of the collective consciousness that we observe today. Moreover, many parents today do not consciously and genuinely care about their children’s souls, a state of the world that has become very important to me, as childhood is a period of great emotional intensity when their conditioning influences the shape of their destiny. Non-loving relationships tend to derive from indifferent parenting, and the sublimation that occurs as a result is a strong theme in my short film, “My Mother Loves Me”.
