						Directors Statement:
As a result of my Ukrainian heritage and the recent events that shaped my country’s revolution, I felt in me a strong desire to bring light to the absurdity I was observing in the world. There is a powerful sense of disconnection between morality and the behaviors of human beings in times of war. I witnessed disturbing footage of rioters ‘playing’ with dead bodies in the midst of their violent rampages. It paid tribute to the irrational behavior of our generation, acting out in inappropriate ways in order to entertain themselves.
I was also inspired by a segment from Bunuel’s “Phantom of Liberty”, where a mother learns of her daughter’s disappearance and frantically asks her teacher where she’s been, all the while her daughter screaming “Mom, I’m here!” right by her side. It felt similar in theme to a bizarre dream I once had, where I floated through a bar and witnessed human beings walking around an art display of a dead person, an artistic choice by the designer. These experiences all felt to be an accurate representation of the collective consciousness that we observe today. Moreover, many parents today do not consciously and genuinely care about their children’s souls, a state of the world that has become very important to me, as childhood is a period of great emotional intensity when their conditioning influences the shape of their destiny. Non-loving relationships tend to derive from indifferent parenting, and the sublimation that occurs as a result is a strong theme in my short film, “My Mother Loves Me”.

						An eclectic writer from a very young age, Anastasia Mamontenko began to nurture her passion for story telling by writing her very first short story at the age of 7 as a gift for her parents. Upon receiving praise, she began to write plays for her friends and rehearse occasional performances for their families. She also wrote plays for school and performed in them, one being “Peaches” by ‘O. Henry’, a televised play that attracted guests from the region. At 14, Anastasia published her first collection of short stories titled “First Day of Spring”, mostly devoted to young love and stories of friendship. While her books sold at the GreenWave Book Market, she decided to spend time at orphanages giving readings to various groups of children that she grew close to.
A powerful influence in Anastasia’s life was her grandfather, a writer and artist, who inspired her to publish her second collection of short stories, “Three Skies”, at age 16. Though all rewarding as experiences, she pursued her truest passion of filmmaking soon after, taking courses at the Odessa Film Studio and writing/directing a feature, “Sadom”, about a teenage girl struggling with her imperfect world and falling for an optimistic paraplegic inspiring her to create her perfect world within. The film was placed in the ‘Young Filmmakers’ Program at the Odessa International Film Festival, an experience she will always cherish. At 18 Anastasia pursued an apprenticeship at the London College of Communications, leading her to a filmmaking conservatory at the New York Film Academy in Los Angeles upon completion. She is scheduled to complete another conservatory in screenwriting next year while actively exposing her film through the international festival network.
Anastasia hopes to continue to create stories and worlds that will stir a tapestry of feelings and emotions in international audiences, to challenge their mindsets and inspire a conversation revolving the improvement of our human experience.
